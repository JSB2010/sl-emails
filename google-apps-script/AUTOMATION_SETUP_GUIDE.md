# üèà Sports Email Automation Setup Guide

Complete automation system that generates and sends sports emails every Sunday.

## üìã Overview

**Sunday 3:00 PM (Mountain Time)**: GitHub Actions generates HTML files and commits them
**Sunday 4:00 PM (Mountain Time)**: Google Apps Script fetches files and sends emails

## üìÖ How Week Selection Works

The system generates emails for the **next occurring Monday**:
- **Sep 29 (Mon) - Oct 5 (Sun)**: Generates emails for week of Oct 6
- **Oct 6 (Mon)**: Still generates for Oct 6 (gives flexibility for manual reruns)
- **Oct 7 (Tue) - Oct 12 (Sun)**: Generates emails for week of Oct 13

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

### Timezone Adjustment
The GitHub Actions workflow is set for **Mountain Time**. If you're in a different timezone:

1. Edit `.github/workflows/generate-sports-emails.yml`
2. Change the cron schedule:
   - Current: `'0 22 * * 0'` (3:00 PM Mountain = 10:00 PM UTC)
   - For Eastern Time: `'0 20 * * 0'` (3:00 PM Eastern = 8:00 PM UTC)
   - For Pacific Time: `'0 23 * * 0'` (3:00 PM Pacific = 11:00 PM UTC)

### Email Customization
In the Google Apps Script, you can customize:
- **Subject lines**: Update the subject in `sendEmailToRecipients` calls
- **From name**: Change `EMAIL_FROM_NAME` in CONFIG
- **Reply-to address**: Update `replyTo` in the email options

## üîç Monitoring & Troubleshooting

### GitHub Actions Monitoring
1. Go to **Actions** tab in your repository
2. Click on any workflow run to see details
3. Green checkmark = success, red X = failure
4. Click on failed runs to see error details

### Google Apps Script Monitoring
1. In Apps Script editor, go to **Executions** (left sidebar)
2. See all recent runs and their status
3. Click on any execution to see detailed logs

### Common Issues & Solutions

**GitHub Actions Issues:**
- **No games found**: Check if Kent Denver athletics website is accessible
- **Permission denied**: Make sure repository has Actions enabled
- **Python errors**: Check if `requirements.txt` has all needed packages

**Google Apps Script Issues:**
- **File not found**: GitHub Actions might not have run yet, or files weren't generated
- **Gmail quota exceeded**: You can send 100 emails/day (consumer) or 1,500/day (Workspace)
- **Authorization errors**: Re-run the authorization process

## üìä Optional: Email Activity Logging

To track email sending history:

1. Create a new Google Sheet
2. Add headers: Date, Status, Message, Week Folder
3. Copy the sheet ID from the URL
4. In the Apps Script, uncomment the logging section in `logEmailActivity()`
5. Replace `YOUR_SPREADSHEET_ID_HERE` with your sheet ID

## üö® Error Notifications

The system will email you if something goes wrong. Update the admin email:

```javascript
const adminEmail = 'your-email@kentdenver.org';
```
