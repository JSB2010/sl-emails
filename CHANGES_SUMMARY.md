# ✅ Dynamic Text Variations for Arts Events - Complete!

## 🎯 What Was Implemented:

### 1. ✅ Python Script - Dynamic Text Based on Arts Events
The `generate_games.py` script now:
- **Detects if there are arts events** in the week
- **Uses different text variations** depending on whether there are arts events or not
- **Adds metadata** to the HTML so Google Apps Script can read it

#### Text Variations Added:
- **Hero Text** (12 variations each):
  - With arts: Mentions "sports and arts events", "athletes and performers", "fields and stages"
  - Without arts: Mentions only "sports", "athletes", "fields"
  
- **CTA Text** (12 variations each):
  - With arts: "Come cheer and applaud", "athletes and performers", "games and performances"
  - Without arts: "Come cheer", "athletes", "games"
  
- **Intro Text** (12 variations each):
  - With arts: "competitions and performances", "athletes and artists", "compete and perform"
  - Without arts: "competitions", "athletes", "compete"

#### How It Works:
```python
# The script checks if any events are arts events
has_arts_events = any(isinstance(event, Event) for event in all_events)

# Then passes this to the text variation function
text_variations = get_dynamic_text_variations(start_date, has_arts_events)
```

#### HTML Changes:
- Added meta tag: `<meta name="has-arts-events" content="true" />` or `"false"`
- Title changes from "Games This Week" to "Games and Performances This Week" when arts events exist

### 2. ✅ Google Apps Script - Dynamic Subject Lines
The `sports-email-sender.gs` script now:
- **Reads the meta tag** from the HTML to detect arts events
- **Changes the subject line** based on whether there are arts events

#### Subject Line Logic:
- **With arts events**: "Sports and Performances This Week: September 29 - October 05"
- **Without arts events**: "Sports This Week: September 29 - October 05"

#### How It Works:
```javascript
// Extract the meta tag
const hasArtsMatch = html.match(/<meta name="has-arts-events" content="(true|false)"/i);
const hasArts = hasArtsMatch && hasArtsMatch[1] === 'true';

// Use different subject prefix
const subjectPrefix = hasArts ? 'Sports and Performances This Week' : 'Sports This Week';
```

## 📋 Files Modified:

### 1. `sports-emails/generate_games.py`
- Updated `get_dynamic_text_variations()` to accept `has_arts_events` parameter
- Added 12 hero text variations for sports+arts
- Added 12 hero text variations for sports-only
- Added 12 CTA text variations for sports+arts
- Added 12 CTA text variations for sports-only
- Added 12 intro text variations for sports+arts
- Added 12 intro text variations for sports-only
- Updated `generate_html_email()` to detect arts events
- Added meta tag to HTML output
- Changed title based on arts events presence

### 2. `google-apps-script/sports-email-sender.gs`
- Updated `extractSubject()` to read meta tag
- Added logic to change subject line based on arts events
- Fallback subjects for both cases

## 🎨 Example Text Differences:

### Hero Text Example:
**With Arts:**
> "The Sun Devil spirit shines bright this week! Our Kent Denver students are ready to compete and perform across 5 sports and arts events. Go Devils! 🔥😈🎭"

**Without Arts:**
> "The Sun Devil spirit shines bright this week! Our Kent Denver athletes are ready to compete across 5 sports. Go Devils! 🔥😈"

### CTA Text Example:
**With Arts:**
> "Show your Sun Devil pride! Come cheer and applaud as our athletes and performers represent Kent Denver across every sport, stage, and grade level."

**Without Arts:**
> "Show your Sun Devil pride! Come cheer as our athletes compete for Kent Denver across every sport and grade level."

### Subject Line Example:
**With Arts:**
> "Sports and Performances This Week: October 06 - October 12"

**Without Arts:**
> "Sports This Week: October 06 - October 12"

## ✅ Testing:

### To Test Locally:
```bash
cd sports-emails
python generate_games.py --this-week
```

Then check the generated HTML files:
1. Look for the meta tag: `<meta name="has-arts-events" content="true" />`
2. Check the title: Should say "Games and Performances This Week" if arts events exist
3. Read the hero text: Should mention "performers" and "stages" if arts events exist

### To Test Google Apps Script:
1. Copy the updated `google-apps-script/sports-email-sender.gs` to your Google Apps Script project
2. Run `testGitHubAccess()` - check the logs for the subject line
3. Run `sendTestEmail()` - check the email subject in your inbox

## 🎯 What This Achieves:

✅ **Contextual Text**: The email text now makes sense whether there are arts events or not
✅ **Clear Subject Lines**: Recipients know immediately if there are performances
✅ **Professional Tone**: Text flows naturally in both scenarios
✅ **Consistent Variations**: All 12 variations work for both cases
✅ **Automatic Detection**: No manual configuration needed - it just works!

## 📝 Next Steps:

1. **Commit the changes** to git
2. **Copy updated Google Apps Script** to your project
3. **Test with a week that has arts events** (if available)
4. **Test with a week that has no arts events** (most weeks)
5. **Verify subject lines** are correct in both cases

---

**All done!** The system now intelligently adapts its language based on what's happening that week. 🎉
