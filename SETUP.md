# üèà Sports Email Automation Setup Guide

Complete automation system that generates and sends sports emails every Sunday.

## üìã Overview

**Sunday 3:00 PM (Mountain Time)**: GitHub Actions generates HTML files and commits them  
**Sunday 4:00 PM (Mountain Time)**: Google Apps Script fetches files and sends emails

## üìÖ How Week Selection Works

The system generates emails for the **next occurring Monday**:
- **Sep 29 (Mon) - Oct 5 (Sun)**: Generates emails for week of Oct 6
- **Oct 6 (Mon)**: Still generates for Oct 6 (gives flexibility for manual reruns)
- **Oct 7 (Tue) - Oct 12 (Sun)**: Generates emails for week of Oct 13

   - For Pacific Time: `'0 23 * * 0'` (3:00 PM Pacific = 11:00 PM UTC)

### Email Configuration

## üîç Monitoring & Troubleshooting

### GitHub Actions Monitoring
1. Go to **Actions** tab in your repository
2. Click on any workflow run to see details
3. Green checkmark = success, red X = failure
4. Click on failed runs to see error details

### Google Apps Script Monitoring
1. In Apps Script editor, go to **Executions** (left sidebar)
2. See all recent runs and their status
3. Click on any execution to see detailed logs

### Common Issues & Solutions

**GitHub Actions Issues:**
- **No games found**: Check if Kent Denver athletics website is accessible
- **Permission denied**: Make sure repository has Actions enabled and write permissions
- **Python errors**: Check if `requirements.txt` has all needed packages

**Google Apps Script Issues:**
- **File not found**: GitHub Actions might not have run yet, or files weren't generated
- **Gmail quota exceeded**: You can send 100 emails/day (consumer) or 1,500/day (Workspace)
- **Authorization errors**: Re-run the authorization process
- **Emojis showing as ÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩ**: FIXED! The script now uses `MailApp` with UTF-8 encoding

### Emoji Fix Details
The emoji corruption issue was caused by character encoding problems. The fix:
- Changed from `GmailApp.sendEmail()` to `MailApp.sendEmail()`
- Added explicit `charset: 'UTF-8'` parameter
- Fetch GitHub files with UTF-8 encoding: `response.getContentText('UTF-8')`

## üìä Optional: Email Activity Logging

To track email sending history:

1. Create a new Google Sheet
2. Add headers: Date, Status, Message, Week Folder
3. Copy the sheet ID from the URL
4. In the Apps Script, uncomment the logging section in `logEmailActivity()`
5. Replace `YOUR_SPREADSHEET_ID_HERE` with your sheet ID

## üö® Error Notifications

The system will email you if something goes wrong. The admin email is already set to `jbarkin28@kentdenver.org`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Manual Override

If you need to send emails manually:
1. Go to your Apps Script project
2. Select `sendSportsEmailsManual` function
3. Click **Run**

If you need to generate files manually:
1. Go to GitHub Actions
2. Click "Run workflow" on the "Generate Sports Emails" workflow
